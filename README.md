##  Server-side using NodeJS, Express, and SQLite!
 
### Tasks:  
	1. Build my own Node/Express API.
	2. The API should be built upon an SQLite database that I'll populate with "dummy data" to simulate the data returned by the original API.
 	3. The goal is to keep the front end the same so I will want to emulate the structure of the original API's JSON objects so that the front-end will display the data correctly.
	4. Make sure to add a .gitignore file to exclude all node modules from git so that my Express module and all its dependencies do not get stored in git.
	5. Make sure that my SQLite database file, populated with sample data, is committed to GitHub along with my code.
	6. Make sure to have a package.json file listing all required back-end node module requirements.
 	7. Add Bootstrap to your front-end and experiment with Bootstrap table styling to make your table of API data look better. For help with Bootstrap table styling, refer to: [Tables - Bootstrap v4.6](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/content/tables/)
